    <h1>The Earth</h1>




     <h2>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place in the universe currently known to host life. It formed approximately 4.54 billion years ago from gas and dust in the early solar system. 
Physical Structure and Composition
Dimensions: Earth is the fifth largest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of roughly 7,926 miles (12,756 km) at the equator.
Shape: It is an oblate spheroid (a "squashed" ball) that bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles due to its rotation.
Internal Layers:
Crust: The thin, solid outer layer where we live, making up about 1% of Earth's volume.
Mantle: The thickest layer (1,800 miles/2,900 km deep), made of hot, semi-solid rock that flows slowly like caramel.
Outer Core: A liquid layer of iron and nickel.
Inner Core: A solid, extremely hot ball of iron and nickel with temperatures reaching up to 10,800°F (6,000°C)—hotter than the surface of the sun. 
Surface and Environment
Ocean World: Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, mostly in the global ocean, which contains 97% of the planet's water supply.
Atmosphere: Composed of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with traces of argon and carbon dioxide. This "blanket" protects life from harmful radiation and incoming meteoroids.
Magnetic Field: Generated by the spinning liquid outer core, this magnetosphere shields the planet from destructive solar winds.
Plate Tectonics: Earth is the only planet in the solar system with active tectonic plates that move, collide, and slide, creating mountains, volcanoes, and earthquakes. 
Orbit and Rotation
Day and Night: It takes Earth roughly 23.9 hours to complete one rotation on its axis.
Yearly Cycle: It takes 365.25 days to orbit the Sun once. The extra quarter-day is accounted for by adding a "leap day" every four years.
Seasons: Earth's axis is tilted at 23.4 degrees, which causes different parts of the planet to receive more or less sunlight throughout the year, creating the seasons.
Distance: Earth is on average 93 million miles (150 million km) from the Sun, a distance known as 1 Astronomical Unit (AU). 
The Moon
Cosmic Companion: Earth has only one permanent natural satellite, the Moon.
Stability: The Moon's gravity stabilizes Earth's "wobble," making the climate more stable over thousands of years.
Tides: It is primarily responsible for creating ocean tides.
Drifting Away: The Moon is gradually moving away from Earth at a rate of about 4 cm per year. 
Unique Records
Driest Place: The Atacama Desert in Chile, outside of the Antarctic dry valleys.
Largest Ice Sheet: Antarctica, which holds 90% of Earth's ice and 70% of its freshwater.
Largest Living Structure: The Great Barrier Reef is the biggest structure built by living organisms.
Longest Mountain Range: Mostly underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.
