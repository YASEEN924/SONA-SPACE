    <h1>The Mars</h1>
    <p>Often called the Red Planet, Mars is a cold, desert world located about 142 million miles (228 million km) from the Sun. It is one of the most intensely explored bodies in our solar system and the only planet currently inhabited entirely by robots. 
Planetary Basics
Size and Mass: Mars is the second-smallest planet in the solar system, roughly half the size of Earth (3,390 km radius) and possessing only 11% of Earth's mass.
Time and Seasons: A day on Mars, called a sol, lasts 24.6 hours. A Martian year is nearly twice as long as Earth's at 687 days. Like Earth, it has four seasons due to a 25-degree axial tilt, though they last much longer.
Gravity: Its surface gravity is only 38% of Earth's; you could jump nearly three times higher there.
Moons: Mars has two small, potato-shaped moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are thought to be captured asteroids. Phobos is slowly spiraling toward Mars and is expected to crash into it or break into a ring in about 50 million years. 
Atmosphere & Climate
Composition: The atmosphere is extremely thin (less than 1% of Earth's pressure) and consists of 96% carbon dioxide, 1.93% argon, and 1.89% nitrogen.
Temperatures: It is a world of extremes, with temperatures ranging from a high of 20°C (70°F) near the equator to as low as -153°C (-225°F) at the poles.
Weather: Mars experiences massive dust storms that can engulf the entire planet for months. It also has clouds, wind, and even carbon dioxide snow (dry ice) at the poles. 
Extreme Geography
Olympus Mons: The tallest volcano and mountain in the solar system, standing three times higher than Mount Everest (about 25 km tall) and covering an area the size of Arizona.
Valles Marineris: A massive canyon system stretching over 4,000 km—long enough to span the United States. It is up to 7 km deep, dwarfng the Grand Canyon.
The Dichotomy: Mars has two distinct faces: the northern hemisphere consists mainly of smooth, low-lying plains, while the southern hemisphere is rugged, cratered highlands. 
The Search for Life & Water
Ancient Water: There is clear evidence from dry riverbeds, deltas, and minerals that liquid water once flowed abundantly on the surface billions of years ago.
Current Water: Today, water exists primarily as ice at the polar caps and beneath the surface. There are signs of seasonal "briny" (salty) water flows on some crater walls.
Potential Habitability: NASA’s Perseverance and Curiosity rovers are currently searching for biosignatures—clues that microbial life may have existed in the past. 
Exploration History
First Successful Flyby: Mariner 4 in 1965.
First Landings: The Viking 1 and 2 landers in 1976.
Recent Milestones: The Ingenuity helicopter successfully completed 72 flights between 2021 and 2024, proving that powered flight is possible in the thin Martian air.
