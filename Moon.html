    <h1>The Moon</h1>
    <p>The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, is a rocky world approximately one-quarter the size of Earth. It has a huge influence on our planet, from stabilizing Earth’s axial tilt to creating the ocean tides we see every day. 
Core Facts & Characteristics
Distance & Size: It orbits at an average distance of 238,855 miles (384,400 km). Its diameter is roughly 2,159 miles, about the distance from New York City to Phoenix.
Gravity: Lunar gravity is only one-sixth of Earth’s, meaning you could jump six times higher there.
Temperature Extremes: Without an atmosphere to trap heat, temperatures swing wildly from 260°F (127°C) in the sun to -280°F (-173°C) in the dark.
Atmosphere: It has an incredibly thin, unbreathable layer called an exosphere. 
Formation and Geology
The Giant Impact: Most scientists believe the Moon formed roughly 4.5 billion years ago when a Mars-sized object named Theia collided with a young Earth, sending debris into orbit that eventually clumped together.
Structure: Like Earth, it has a core, mantle, and crust. Interestingly, the crust is lopsided, being much thicker on the far side than the side facing us.
Surface Features: The surface is covered in lunar regolith (powdery dust and rock). The dark patches we see are called maria—basins filled with ancient, solidified lava. 
Movement and Appearance
Tidal Locking: The Moon takes about 27.3 days to both orbit Earth and rotate once on its axis. Because these times match, the same side always faces Earth.
Phases: We see different "shapes" of the Moon (like crescent or full) because we only see the portion of the Moon that is currently being lit by the Sun as it moves around us.
Drifting Away: The Moon is slowly moving away from Earth at a rate of about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) per year. 
Human Exploration
Moonwalks: Only 12 people (all American men from the NASA Apollo missions) have ever walked on the Moon, between 1969 and 1972.
Water Discovery: Scientists have confirmed the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and even small amounts on sunlit surfaces.
The Future: NASA’s Artemis program aims to return humans to the lunar surface in the late 2020s, including the first woman and person of color.
